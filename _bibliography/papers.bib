	abstract = {{This work presents a UML/MOF meta-modeling infrastructure, following the MDA approach, which is oriented to the design space exploration of embedded systems, based on the independent specification of application and platform. A mapping from the application into the platform is implemented by model transformations. A meta-data repository implementation is also introduced, automatically providing an Application Programming Interface (API) that is suitable to the manipulation of the UML meta-models and models and to the implementation of design tools for embedded systems. In order to illustrate the applicability of these resources, a source code generation tool for embedded software has been implemented and applied in a concrete case study.}},
