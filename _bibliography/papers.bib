This paper proposes a distributed reconfigurable architecture for application migration from failed modules to working ones. The feasible system reconfiguration states are determined off-line to provide the expected configuration in foreseen situations. Model checking is used to determine feasible configurations evaluating specific temporal properties. A case study is used to show the application of the presented approach as a proof of concept.}},

	abstract = {{This work presents a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) framework to improve embedded system design. The framework adopts concepts from MDE for the automatic generation of a control and data flow internal representation, starting from the functional specification of an embedded application described using UML class and sequence diagrams. By means of transformations rules applied on the UML model of the embedded system, an MOF-based (Meta Object Facility is a standard representation for meta-models and models proposed by OMG) internal representation is automatically obtained, which is iteratively mapped into a hardware/software implementation by means of model transformations. This mapping is optimized by a design space exploration (DSE) method based on a categorical graph product. The model transformations have also as input a platform model, which specifies the available hardware, software and interface resources, and produce an implementation model, on which software synthesis, communication synthesis and high-level synthesis algorithms are applied to generate the final implementation. A case study is described to illustrate the application of the framework.}},

A mapping from the application into the platform is implemented by model transformations. A meta-data repository implementation is also introduced, automatically providing an Application Programming Interface (API) that is suitable to the manipulation of the UML meta-models and models and to the implementation of design tools for embedded systems. In order to illustrate the applicability of these resources, a source code generation tool for embedded software has been implemented and applied in a concrete case study.}},
